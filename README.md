## Overview

**The Custodian** is a pixel-art puzzle-platformer where you guide a mysterious entity through four atmospheric levels filled with perilous traps and environmental puzzles. It was created by a team of three high school students with minimal prior game development experience during a rapid, two-day game jam.

## Features

- **Four hand-crafted levels**: Each presents distinct challenges, mechanics, and obstacles.
- **Unique pixel-art style**: Atmospheric backgrounds and a mysterious protagonist.
- **Physics-based platforming**: Moving platforms, falling obstacles, gravity wells, and more.
- **Checkpoints and power-ups**: Master each challenge and advance through the game.
- **Original SFX and sound cues**.

## Team & Credits

- **Programming**: Sukarth, Hekinav & Ropva
- **Level Design**: Sukarth
- **Artists**: Ropva & Hekinav
- **Sound Effects**: Ropva & Hekinav
